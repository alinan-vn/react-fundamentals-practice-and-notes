# First steps

# Notes and structure
- in the `./notes` folder, there are notes on the topics described on the file name. For example, `./notes/hooks.md` has notes on the topic of react hooks.
- routing is done in the `./src/App.js` file
- components are in the `./src/components` folder and the code written can be described by their parent folder's name. For example, code in `./src/components/functionComponentsPractice/useStatePractice/index.jsx` has code practicing the `useState` hook.
- Styling is done through a mixture of `reactstrap` and `scss` with the former taking the majority of the bulk, and scss for minor cosmetic changes.
